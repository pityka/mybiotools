1 (of 1) markers to be included from [ kicsi.map ]
Warning, found 2 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ kicsi.nosex ]
2 individuals read from [ kicsi.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 2 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 2 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
2 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 2 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 2 of unspecified sex
Writing pedigree information to [ kicsi.fam ] 
Writing map (extended format) information to [ kicsi.bim ]

Options in effect:
	--tfile grmtest_tiny2
	--make-bed
	--out grmtest_tiny2

Reading pedigree information from [ grmtest_tiny2.tfam ] 
6 individuals read from [ grmtest_tiny2.tfam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 6 missing
1 males, 1 females, and 4 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 4 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ grmtest_tiny2.nosex ]
5 (of 5) markers to be included from [ grmtest_tiny2.tped ]
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 5 SNPs
6 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.9
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 5 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 6 missing
After filtering, 1 males, 1 females, and 4 of unspecified sex
Writing pedigree information to [ grmtest_tiny2.fam ] 
Writing map (extended format) information to [ grmtest_tiny2.bim ]

Reading map (extended format) from [ 4b.bim ] 
2 markers to be included from [ 4b.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ 4b.fam ] 
3 individuals read from [ 4b.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 3 missing
1 males, 1 females, and 1 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 1 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ 4b.nosex ]
Reading genotype bitfile from [ 4b.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2 SNPs
3 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 3 missing
After filtering, 1 males, 1 females, and 1 of unspecified sex

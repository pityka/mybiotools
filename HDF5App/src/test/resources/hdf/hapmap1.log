Reading pedigree information from [ hapmap1.tfam ] 
89 individuals read from [ hapmap1.tfam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 89 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 89 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 89 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ hapmap1.nosex ]
83534 (of 83534) markers to be included from [ hapmap1.tped ]
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83534 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.99441
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83534 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 89 missing
